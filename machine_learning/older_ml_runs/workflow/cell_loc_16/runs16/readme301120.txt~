data16: datasets with 16 class labels, one for each of the 16 GO cell
locations
draft_run161120: early runs testing out hyperparameters on just one cell location,
membrane
 - cell_loc16_scores.txt, log_171120.txt: same as similar files described below
 - feature_type.txt: describes the type of features (continuous/categorical)m
   needed by my ml script
 - ml_ohp_16cl.py: ml script, hp means hyperparameters, dunno what o means but
   not important
outdated: outdated scripts and associated files, can ignore as these dont work


Files
ada_cell16_scores.txt, brf_cell16_scores.txt, logr_cell16_scores.txt,
lsv_cell16_scores.txt, rf_cell16_scores.txt: ml scores after running their
respective ml scripts below
ada_log211120.txt, logr_log221120.txt, lsv_log221120.txt: log file after running
their respective ml scripts
lsv_cell16_d_scores.txt, lsv_d_log221120.txt; not sure what these arem probably
draft runs of lsv, can ignore


Scripts
ada_16cl.py, brf_16cl.py, logr_16cl.py, lsv_16cl.py, rf_16cl.py: ml script using
adaboost, balanced random forest, logistric regression and random forest
trained to predict 16 cell locations
 - produces their respective scores file above
test_lsvm_16cl_v2.py: test script to make sure ml script works, has some
adjustments like 2-fold cv for gridsearch, only one set of hyerparameters
tested etc
