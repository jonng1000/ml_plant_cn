Scripts
ada_16cl.py, brf_16cl.py, logr_16cl.py, lsv_16cl.py: ml script using
adaboost, balanced random forest, logistric regression and linear svm
trained to predict 16 cell locations
ada_16cl_v2.py, brf_16cl_v2.py, logr_16cl_v2.py, lsv_16cl_v2.py,
rf_16cl_v2.py: version 2 of the above scripts,
improved version
cnb_16cl_v2.py, gnb_16cl_v2.py, gbc_16cl_v2.py: complement and gaussian
naive bayes and gradient boosting classifier, just like version 2
scripts above, but it doesn't work. See OneNote entry around this date for
more info.
models_wrapper.py: wrapper script to wrap around ml scripts, but didn't
use
test_ada_16cl_v2.py: test script to make sure ml script works, has some
adjustments like 2-fold cv for gridsearch, only one set of hyerparameters
tested etc
