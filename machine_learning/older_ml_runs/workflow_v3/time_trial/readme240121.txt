Folders
lsv_test, logr_test: tests to determine how many iterations is needed for
convergence

Scripts
multi_models_go_v2.py: ml workflow script
multi_go_wrapper.py: wrapper script for above script
rem_specific_pcg.py: removes parent and child GO terms for each GO term used
as class label

Files
class_targets_go.txt: class labels with GO terms, used for ml workflow
feature_type.txt, go.obo, ml_dataset_dc.txt: feature types, GO file, ml
dataset files, respectively, used for ml workflow

Notes
Originally swapped the order of the first two GO terms in the class targets
file, when testing my workflow to see how long logistic regression takes on the
full workflow, but I have swapped back
