Folders
hp_trial: Multiple runs of my workflow using randomsearch, to see if there's
any hp which shows up most frequently as being linked to high scores
- results: 5 iterations of random search
- results_10: 10 iterations of random search
- results_20: 20 iterations of random search (took about 1 wk to run,
so can use this as a benchmark to plan and execute future ml workflows)
time_trial: folder containing ml work done to measure time taken by various
ml algos, check folder's readme for more info

Files
ct_go_hp.txt: list of 71 GO terms for ml workflow, uses 5 iterations of
random search
ct_go_hp_v2.txt: list of 135 GO terms for ml workflow, uses 10 and later 20,
iterations of random search
feature_type.txt: lists categories of features, used in ml workflow

GO term used as class label
