output_interpro: ml scores when interpro computational GO terms
are used to predict experimental GO class targets
output_tair: ml scores when tair computational GO terms
are used to predict experimental GO class targets

Files
class_labels_linux.txt: GO class targets for ml,  with linux
line endings
feature_type.txt: list of feature types for ml work
GO_counts.txt: 

go.obo: GO database
log050521*, log090521*: log file from my ml workflow, number of
cores is indicated, 4 means 4 cores and models are pickled, 4b
means 4 cores
log_dryrun.txt: log file with using parallel with its --dryrun
option, on my ml workflow
ml_dataset_dc.txt : ml dataset
test_dataset.txt: smaller, test dataset

Scripts
create_go_features.py: create computational GO features

multi_go_wrapper.py: wrapper script for ml workflow
rf_go.py: runs ml workflow, with a specific number of cores
rf_go_v2.py: updated version of rf_go.py, but models are pickled
rem_specific_pcg.py: removes parent and child GO terms corresponding to the
class label
wrapper_go.py: wrapper script for ml workflow
wrapper_go_v2.py: updated version of wrapper_go.py to make things more efficient

Misc
Needed to do below to change how my class labels are named in the target list:
sed 's/go_GO/GO/g' class_labels_go.txt > class_labels_linux.txt
This is to make my target list compatible with my new workflow
