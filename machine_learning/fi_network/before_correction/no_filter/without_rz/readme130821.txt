diff_grps: looking at different groups of features to explore why mutual
rank distribution has a weird shape
- explore_mr_grps.py: explores mutual rank (MR) distributiom for
different feature categories
- *.png: histograms from explore_mr_grps.py, showing MR distribution

Scripts
build_fi_network.py: build mutual ranks from all feature ranks
explore_net_prop.py: explores mutual rank (MR) distribution  and obtain
proportion of feature categories for high and low MR clusters

histogram of this info
explore_line_test.py: line plot for mutual rank distribution
explore_network_box.py: boxplot of mutual rank distribution
perm_test_prop.py: permutation test on features to see if there's any
significant difference between two clusters of features observed from
mutual rank distribution
