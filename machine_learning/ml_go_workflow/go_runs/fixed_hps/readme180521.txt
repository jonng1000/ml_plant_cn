Folders
outdated: contains outdated data for ml, can ignore
- class_labels, class_labels64, class_labels128:
folder contains files of GO class targets for ml,
different folders has different number of files, number
at the end of the folder is related to the number of files
- outputX, where X is 1/2/3/8/16/32/64/128: results from ml
workflow when that number of cores is run using parallel

output 4b: same desc as that for outputX, but 4 cores is used,
4b is used as pickled models are not saved, output4 has pickled
models which is used for downstream analysis, and hence is
not in the outdated folder

Files
class_labels_go.txt: list of GO class targets for ml
class_labels_linux.txt: same as class_labels_go.txt, but with linux
line endings for use with parallel
feature_type.txt: list of feature types for ml work
go.obo: GO database
log050521*, log090521*: log file from my ml workflow, number of
cores is indicated, 4 means 4 cores and models are pickled, 4b
means 4 cores
log_dryrun.txt: log file with using parallel with its --dryrun
option, on my ml workflow
ml_dataset_dc.txt : ml dataset
test_dataset.txt: smaller, test dataset

Scripts
multi_go_wrapper.py: wrapper script for ml workflow
rf_go.py: runs ml workflow, with a specific number of cores
rf_go_v2.py: updated version of rf_go.py, but models are pickled
rem_specific_pcg.py: removes parent and child GO terms corresponding to the
class label
wrapper_go.py: wrapper script for ml workflow
wrapper_go_v2.py: updated version of wrapper_go.py to make things more efficient

Misc
Needed to do below to change how my class labels are named in the target list:
sed 's/go_GO/GO/g' class_labels_go.txt > class_labels_linux.txt
This is to make my target list compatible with my new workflow
