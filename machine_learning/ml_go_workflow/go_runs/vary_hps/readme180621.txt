Scripts
rf_go_rs.py: runs ml workflow, with 5 iterations of random search for hp optimisation
rem_specific_pcg.py: removes parent and child GO terms corresponding to the
class label
wrapper_go_v2.py: wrapper script for ml workflow

Misc
Needed to do below to change how my class labels are named in the target list:
sed 's/go_GO/GO/g' class_labels_go.txt > class_labels_linux.txt
This is to make my target list compatible with my new workflow
