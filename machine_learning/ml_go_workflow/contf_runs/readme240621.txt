log_dryrun220621.txt, log_testrun220621.txt, log_dry220621.txt:
dry runs to show what happens when i am running my workflow,
used to help me repair the bugs
- ml_dataset_mod.txt: modified ml dataset, replaced spaces in continuous
feature names with _, for debugging, but it didnt work
- mod_data_contf.py: modifies ml daatset, by replacing spaces in continuous
feature names with _, for debugging, but it didnt work

output: contains output from ml workflow

Files
log290621_9.txt: log file from corrected ml workflow, other files like
this with different (underscore followed by a number) prefixes,
outdated log files produced during workflow correction efforts, can ignore

log_dry290621_9.txt: log files from ml workflow dry runs, files with/no
prefixes  are just older versions produced during workflow correction, can ignore
- log_test290621*.txt: log files with these names are also dry runs

ml_dataset_dc.txt: downcasted ml dataset for ml work

mod_class_labels_contf.txt: modified list of continuous features as targets for
ml workflow, has job_id added

mod_class_labels_linux.txt: similar to mod_class_labels_contf.txt, but with
windows line endings replaced by linux line endings, for use in ml workflow

output_names_cor.txt: list of names of continuous features successfully completed
by ml workflow, used in examine_error.py, after workflow correction

output_names.txt: list of names of continuous features successfully completed
by ml workflow, used in examine_error.py, before workflow correction

test_class_labels_linux.txt: short list of features for testing ml workflow

test_dataset_contf.txt: small ml datatset for testing ml workflow

Scripts
examine_error.py: explores list of features successfully completed by my ml
