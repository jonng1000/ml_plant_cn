Files
log*.txt: log files for ml workflow
- if file has the _b/2/3 suffix, it means it is paired with the
log file without this suffix
ml_dataset_dc.txt: ml dataset
class_labels16_linux.txt: 16 GO classes (marek selections) for ml workflow
ct_go_hp_linux.txt: 71 GO classes for ml workflow

Scripts:
rf_go_ghp.py: run rf model in my ml workflow, but used selected grps of hps
(selected from hp test - most freq hp grp)
rf_go_v2.py: run rf model in my ml workflow (hp selected are the most freq
individual hps from hp test)
wrapper_go_v2.py: wrapper script to run my ml workflow

Misc
Needed to do below to change how my class labels are named in the target list:
sed 's/go_GO/GO/g' ct_go_hp_linux.txt >  ct_go_hp_linux_t.txt
This is to make my target list compatible with my new workflow
