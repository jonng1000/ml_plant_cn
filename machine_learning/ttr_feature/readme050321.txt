Folders
tests: test folder, where I was just testing mcl to see if graph was symmetrical,
but can ignore these files, where generated based on
https://micans.org/mcl/man/mclfaq.html#goodinput and
https://micans.org/mcl/man/mcxi.html

Files
data.mci, data.tab, out.data.mci.I20: files produced during the process of
running mcl, can see https://micans.org/mcl/
dump.data.mci.I20: output of mcl
out.data.mci.I40, dump.data.mci.I40, out.data.mci.I60: files produced by running
mcl, like those above, but these are done with different inflation values so can
ignore
tftg_reg_net.abc: input file for mcl, made by me, has transcription factor-target
gene edges
