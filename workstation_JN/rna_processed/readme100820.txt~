Folders
kal_output: Contains all output folders from kallisto processing

Scripts
check_3rna_files.py: Checks if RNA-seq data has 3 fastq files and redownloads
them if that is true. Also creates and sorts thru a list containing RNA-seq
run ID and number of processed reads.
check_rna_kal.py: Explores downloaded processed rna data by kallisto
rna_dl_kallisto.py: downloads RNA-seq data and processes it with kallisto,
rna_seq_dl.txt supplies it with RNA-seq run ids. Outdated by rna_kal_cli.py
rna_kal_cli.py: Command line and improved version of rna_dl_kallisto.py,
as it removed the bug where it doesnt process datasets with 3 fastq files
properly
rna_kal_wrapper.py: wrapper script to read in rna_seq_dl.txt (supplies
the RNA-seq run ids) and runs rna_kal_cli.py accordingly

Files
index.html: no idea whats this, dont delete
rna_seq_dl.txt: List of RNA-seq run IDs to download programmatically
Athaliana.idx: index file produced and needed by kallisto
