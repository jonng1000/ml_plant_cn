Folders
kal_output: Contains all output folders from kallisto processing
sleuth_metadata: Metadata for each sub experiment. Each experiment can
be split into several sub experiments, so this folder contains their
metadata
sleuth_output: Sleuth output for each sub experiment
test_environment: for testing kallisto and sleuth programs and output

Scripts
check_3rna_files.py: Checks if RNA-seq data has 3 fastq files and redownloads
them if that is true. Also creates and sorts thru a list containing RNA-seq
run ID and number of processed reads.
check_3rna_cli.py: command line version of check_3rna_files.py, with
further modifications
check_3rna_wrapper.py: wrapper for check_3rna_cli.py, also creates a list,
sorted in ascending order, of the number of RNA reads produced by kallistio
combine_sleuth.py: Combine sleuth output to created one hot encoded features of
genes which are up and down regulated across all experiments.
Produces dge_1HE.txt
process_cs.py: From dge_1HE.txt, replaced blanks with NA, and floats
with integers. Produces dge_1HE_edited.txt
rna_dl_kallisto.py: downloads RNA-seq data and processes it with kallisto,
rna_seq_dl.txt supplies it with RNA-seq run ids. Outdated by rna_kal_cli.py
rna_kal_cli.py: Command line and improved version of rna_dl_kallisto.py,
as it removed the bug where it doesnt process datasets with 3 fastq files
properly
rna_kal_wrapper.py: wrapper script to read in rna_seq_dl.txt (supplies
the RNA-seq run ids) and runs rna_kal_cli.py accordingly
running_sleuth_cli.R: Running sleuth via command line
sleuth_preprocess.py: Preprocessing flies for sleuth. Splits all
experiments into their specific sub experiments with 1 test and 1
control set of samples
sleuth_wrapper.py: Wrapper for running_sleuth_cli.R to run it on all sub
experiments to get their output


Files
index.html: no idea whats this, dont delete
rna_seq_dl.txt: List of RNA-seq run IDs to download programmatically
Athaliana.idx: index file produced and needed by kallisto
dge_1HE_edited.txt: edited dge_1HE.txt
dge_1HE.txt: output from combine_sleuth.py
dge_test_control_labels.tsv: labels for test and control RNA seq samples
log170820.txt: Log file showing print output when rna_kal_cli.py is running

Notes: Quite a lot of scripts to check RNA downloads, because I realise some
files fail sanity checks, so made several scripts to figure out why, but in the
end I realised that sometimes the URL tims out when downloading data, so thats why
the sanity check fails. So I think this is fine
