scripts: build_RF_score_v3.py, rfe_module_v2.py, rf_feature_extract_v2.py;
these scripts are used to generate the output files

folders: test1, test2;
input and output files are shifted into these files.
test1 -> first test of suba predictions, slightly wrong because it has
AraCyc annotation as three separate features (GM, SM, GM and SM).
test2 -> remove above error, still see that ML workflow cannot accurately
identify suba predictions as important features tho
