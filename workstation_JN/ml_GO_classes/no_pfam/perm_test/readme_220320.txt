perm_test_outdated: outdated permutation test reuslts so can ignore,
this is when permutation results keep on getting overwritten, so i
only have the results for the last permutation test, which as
5 permutations

Files
*.txt: they are output files after ML workflow is completed
log .txt files: log files tracking how long my workflow took.
log200320.txt shows how long the permutation test took
while log210320.txt shows how long building the model
from blocks of features took (but this specific process
was run on many cpus simultaneously)

Scripts
*.py: run ML workflow, score modles, calculate importance of features,
build model from blocks of features and score it
