test1: created raw data set from scratch in Mar '20, from PNAS
supplementary data, then did RF ml workflow.
test2: used the raw data set from earlier work done in Jul '19, from PNAS
supplementary data, then did RF ml workflow.

Purpose of these two tests, is to check that my Jul' 19 creation of
the raw data set is done correctly. If it is, my workflow resuls should be similar.
