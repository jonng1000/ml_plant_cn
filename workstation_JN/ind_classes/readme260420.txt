Names of folders are so called to be the same as
the names of their equivalent in my desktop
ind_classes folder.

This folder contains the output from my random forest
workflow, when it is used on 2 GO classes,
Golgi and nucleus. My workflow consists of:
1) Creating raw dataset from PNAS supp data
2) Preprocesing it to make it suitable for machine
learning
3) Randomly selection 1000 features 5 times, from
each GO class. This results in 10 datasets.
Steps 1-3 above are done on desktop, hence their
files arent in this folder, unless they are needed
for the below steps
4) Run  rf_feature_extract_v3_p.py, which requires
rfe_module_v3.py, on the 10 datasets. This generates
model scores, permutation importace and feature
importance. Feature importance not strictly needed
but calculated just in case they are.
5) Run build_RF_perm_f1000.py using output from
step 4 above, to build model using features in
batches, and score models.
Steps 4-5 above are run using workstation, hence
their files are stored here. Files are also grouped
into folders as can be seen here, for better
organisation. Hence if I want to rerun my scripts,
need to shift files around to make them work.
6) Scores and importance of features calculated
by the different ways here, are moved back to
desktop, where my plotting scripts,
explore_scores.py, explore_features.py and
explore_build_s.py are used to create plots for
viewing.
